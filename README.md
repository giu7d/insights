## Motivation

This study objective is not to create an application restricted in a stack. But to elaborate and test SOTA tools that enable a stable and productive stack.
Or goals with the final product is to find a stack that:

1. Improves developer experience;
2. Allows fast deploy e development;
3. Constructs an app with great performance;
4. Defines an architecture to easily componentize and reuse animations;
5. Implements code quality tools (e.g. test, static analysis, linting, etc.);
6. Target the largest number of devices (e.g. ios, android, and web).
